Designed and implemented an end-to-end Business Intelligence (BI) solution based on a simulated crime dataset (50,000+ records). This project involved building a robust ETL pipeline and data warehouse using the Microsoft BI stack.
ðŸ”¹ Built a Star Schema data warehouse with dimension and fact tables to support analytical reporting
ðŸ”¹ Developed ETL workflows in SSIS to extract, cleanse, transform, and load data from multiple sources (CSV & SQL)
ðŸ”¹ Handled Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2) to preserve historical changes (e.g., status updates)
ðŸ”¹ Used Lookups for surrogate key resolution across dimension tables
ðŸ”¹ Created and deployed a cube using SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) with hierarchies and measures
ðŸ”¹ Connected the cube to Excel and Power BI to design OLAP reports and dashboards
â€ƒâ€ƒâ–ª Demonstrated Slice, Dice, Drill-Down, Roll-Up, and Pivot operations
ðŸ”¹ Extended the fact table for accumulating snapshot metrics using derived fields (e.g., transaction processing time)
ðŸ”¹ Published and demonstrated interactive Power BI dashboards with,
matrix tables - Report 1
multiple slicers - Report 
drill-down - Report 2
drill-through reports - Report 4
